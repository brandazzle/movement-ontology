I propose the following possible continuations of the research here presented:

1. Put [[Eidsheim 2015]] and [[O'Callaghan 2007]] in dialogue with each other. 
2. Analyze dances along similar lines to [[Dodd 2007]]. 
3. Investigate further into issues of semiotic theory and dance/music
4. Discuss performance and composition practice that breaks already-presented analyses
5. Critique [[Dodd 2007]], [[Elder 2004]], and possibly [[O'Callaghan 2007]], possibly using ideas and methods from [[Robinson 2020]], [[Kealiinohomoku 1969]], and [[Hilder 2017#Hilder â€“ The Politics of Virtuality|Hilder 2017]].
