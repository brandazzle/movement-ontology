## About
The following are various scraps of notes found among my places (including the notes app and the margins of class notes) where I write down ideas as I have them. Dates are as exact as I can figure.

### 7 September 2021
the awareness of my own [[Robinson 2020|"hungry listening"]] is something that right now I don't feel like will ever slip completely back into being unnoticed/unmarked/default—at least I will do my best to continue that awareness

Sound is created by the processing of the thick vibrational phenomenon through a sound ontology

Question: What is capable of imposing a sound ontology?

Sound exists solely in the interaction between a given vibrational field and a given audile ontology.

**audile frameworks**

is the mp3 a virtuoso? is the playback code? 

Marx fundamental virtuosity speech/locution 

isn't an mp3 just a score?

the recording is a score for a performance by the virtuoso technologies 

The optimal instrumental interface is as close as the vocal apparatus, our primal vibrationally productive apparatus

devised musical performance

bands writing songs? as ex. of above

Investigate what continuum of theater composition vs. improvisation exists

ouroboros of power among audience composer performer

Scores and recordings perform the same social function!

Process in rock and roll where albums would be pressed from different masters for different countries

Sound diffracts around things where light doesn't—sound interiorities (!?)

sign language as dance???

### 1 March 2022
cyo project about mind mapping the paper??

### 8 March 2022
Is any wordless theatre dance? Is dance just wordless theatre??

### 12 March 2022
observer mind that categorizes versus actor mind that responds
(quantum measurement/observation possibly has weird implications here????)

gesture is what happens when semiotics is placed on movement by observer mind

The link between [[Elder 2004|Eldar]] and [[Gottschild 1997|Gottschild]] is the repetition record of gesture; the becoming of a copied kind is playing into the repetition of gesture across time; a gesture repeated is no longer a momentary particular but is now a type which may be repeated, may be transformed

[[Pataphysics]] cannot help us here, my mission is in opposition to its basic ideas

Do words exist mind-independently?

The only reason why we say that a work is being revised is because it continues to be named the same thing
But wait—if works can be performed before they are composed, what differentiates an imperfect token-performance of a work from a performance of an entirely different work?

Non-sonic historical considerations are routinely ignored in period performance practice

Recognizing music theoretical properties is not an aspect of hearing, it is a secondary, enculturated mental process


This isn’t a problem for philosophy, it’s a problem for anthropology. Goddammit.

There is a fundamental inexactitude to performances of dance that performances of music don’t really have, because dance performances consist just in those practices \[which are sufficient but not necessary to generate an instance of a musical work—reword?\]

A video of a dance fundamentally does NOT have the same relationship to The Dance as a recording of a performance of a piece of music has to The Piece
re: the above: is this true? why?

maybe I should take all this to be a view on how the idea of a musical work *functions* in Western art music

### 15 March 2022
Critique the authors

Create the framework for gestural study 


naturalizes aspects of language as well!

Dance has granular identity—“the robot” has no set length, only very fuzzy boundaries
Needs to be perceived to acquire identity—because dance is advanced gesture and gesture is semiotic
Is dance inherently semiotic? Is it semiotic in a way that e.g. music isn’t?


Meaning as a tool which is used by art, it is an instrument with an art – perhaps the most key instrument of art –but it is not necessarily an aspect of a given work of art *in toto.* Asking "what does this work of art mean" is not nearly as useful a question as asking "how does this work of art use meaning?" 
I think part of this is because the word "meaning" is kind of overloaded in normal parlance, or maybe it's my view that is overly simplified—what is my view?

Which reading talked about Swan Lake???

Pre-refutation: it is the *language and culture* and not anything external to it which is being analyzed; furthermore, we cannot say with certainty that Sámi possessed of all the resources that have made possible any Western body of world-knowledge would arrive at the exact same body of facts as we currently have

That's what's wrong with Dawkinsian objectivism: the idea that there is an unenculturated, objective observing subject, something which is in fact blatantly impossible

### 24 March 2022
Re-reading [[Bruno 2007]]

[[Dodd 2007|Dodd's]] assertion that music-theoretical properties can be part of a sonic identity and thus can be heard directly is definitely noit gonna work, but that points to a problem with sonicism—that hearing is enculturated. Can draw on [[Robinson 2020]] to make that point

Can the claim that *hearing* is consistent but auditory *processing* is enculturated be defended? is it coherent? is it even legitimate (can be disproven)? because any attempt to tell what someone hears inevitably involves asking them
where is hearing even located?
do I need to bring Eidsheim to bear on this???

Ideology of absolute art
Might we say that the mind is for the unmarked?

Resonant somatic response;
