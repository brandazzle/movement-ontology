### What is this?

**Materially,** this is a folder full of Markdown text files and PDFs, created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), versioned through GitHub, and connected to a website through [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [Peter Yuen's Zola site solution](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola).

**Conceptually,** this is a chronicle and outline of a string of cross-disciplinary research and thought I have undertaken over the past 6 months or so 

**Teleologically,** this aims to propose a number of more formal projects that might come out of this node of thought
