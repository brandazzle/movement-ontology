### What is this?

**Materially,** this is a folder full of Markdown text files and PDFs, created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), versioned through GitHub, and connected to a website through [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [Peter Yuen's Zola site solution](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola).

**Conceptually,** this is a chronicle and outline of a string of cross-disciplinary research and thought I have followed for the past 6 months or so, with [[Eidsheim (2019) Race of Sound introduction.pdf|Eidsheim's]] proposal of the ontological multiplicity of the voice as an approximate starting point.

**Teleologically,** this aims to propose a number of more formal projects that might come out of this tangled network of thought.

**Realistically,** this is a completely absurd dumping bin for a whole lot of thoughts, created in the hopes that it would help me think them better.

### How do I use it?
Start with the [[Rough Timeline]] to get a sense of linear progression.  
Start with the [[List of Documents]] to get a bird's-eye view.  
Start with [[Eidsheim 2015]] to work non-linearly through the texts.  
Start with the [[Proposals]] to work backwards.
