The sound pressure level meter (SLM), or Ear 2.0, is crucial here because it can convert Ear 1.0 into what Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar call an “inscription device,” that is, an “item of apparatus or particular configuration of such items which can transform a material substance into a figure or diagram which is directly usable” (Latour and Woolgar 1986, 51).

Using an SLM is not like using a radar gun, which requires one to simply point at an object to es timate its speed by calculating frequency changes in the emitted radar signal or laser pulse. Capturing a sound can be quite challenging because, as a mechanical wave traveling from point A  to point B, sound can undergo a range of diffractions and refractions depending on atmospheric conditions such as wind and temperature.

Beside columns for name and institution, the sheet asks participants to indicate their “class.” This is not uncommon in standardization organizations, which operate thanks to volunteer work and aim to represent society more broadly by including experts, private organizations, state representatives, and laypersons. The sheet shows three classes of participants:  “Neutrals,” “Producers,” and “Consumers.” The

Not only that, but the commission was expanding the documents considerably to include much more detailed measurement procedures and analytic criteria than the pre-existing versions.

The focus is that there is a parameter, and we are going to measure it and have criteria to face up to it. That is the concept of “technique.”
