Notes on [[Dodd (2007) Works of Music.pdf]]. 

Dodd argues for a two-part "simple view" of musical works, consisting of “timbral sonicism,” that a musical work’s identity and essential properties solely consist in its sound, and type/token theory, that musical works in general are norm-types—abstract, unstructured, eternally existent entities—whose tokens are particular performances or playings.

The following annotations were made before reading the reviews in detail, and so reflect my initial rejection of Dodd's argument.
