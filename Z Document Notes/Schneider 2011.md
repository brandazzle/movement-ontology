> events, like wars, are never discretely completed, but carry forth in embodied cycles of memory that do not delimit the remembered to the past. For many history

And yet, the quote might also suggest that it is the very pastness of the past that is never complete, never completely finished, but incomplete: cast into the future as a matter for ritual negotiation and as yet undecided interpretive acts of reworking. In this way, events are given to be past, or to become past, by virtue

> If we have become somewhat comfortable with the notion of bodily memory (if not bodily history), and comfortable reading bodies engaged in ritual or repeated actions as carriers of collective memory, we are not entirely comfortable considering gestic acts (re)enacted live to be material trace, despite the material substance that is the body articulating the act.

This is perhaps because the words “document” and “evidence” and “record” are, by the repetitively assumed force of convention in cultures privileging literature over orature25 (or archive over repertoire, to use Diana Taylor’s words), habitually understood in distinction to the bodily, the messily, the “disappearing” live.
