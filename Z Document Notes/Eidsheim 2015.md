The end of the world is thus inexorable and often depicted as an uncontrollable flood—not as a gateway to cleansing and renewal, as with the flood of Noah’s Ark, but as an eternal doom, an irreversible watery state. The element from which we ascended billions of years ago and that we depend on for survival, enjoy in recreation, and use as a means of transportation is also the unstoppable pun­ ishment that will obliterate humanity from the earth.

As the House Foundation preserves her work in institu­ tional memory, the ensemble not only performs it but, since the music is not in notated form (with a few exceptions when it was transcribed much later), the 40 members of the Vocal Ensemble hold, carry, and guard it within their bodies.

Reflecting on Paul Celan’s poetry about the songs of ascent, a series of psalms sung by ancient pilgrims as they climbed a holy mountain via a series of steps, Monk created a movement, light, voice, string quartet, and percussion piece that embodied the energies and dynamics of the circumventional and vertical movement axes. Hence, Songs of Ascension (2008) was a response to

In the dominant view, in which Í sound is the core, perhaps it is not the voice or logos but the sound that is the fetish object of the voice, inhibiting us from knowing the voice more closely 39  and understanding more about its effects on singers and listeners.Moreover, j if we were not deafened by sound, would music appear to us not as an ideal , and fetishized sound that he lps maintain the work concept, but as a compound manifestation of performers’ bodies?
